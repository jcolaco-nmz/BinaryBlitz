# BinaryBlitz

I made this project back in 2015 to learn Swift and iOS app development.

It's a simple SpriteKit game about converting numbers to binary format, with some music made on GarageBand.


#####The game is composed by 3 game modes:
1. Classic - you have 10s for each round
2. Zen - No time constraints
3. Rush - How many rounds you can do in 1 minute

Paying the iOS developer license just to have this free app online isn't worth it anymore, hence I release it as a open source project so people trying to learn how to make SpriteKit games can take a look and learn the basics.
